### **Professional Career and Achievements**

#### **GeoMatrix Solutions (August 2020 \- Present) – Senior Director, Geospatial Data Science**

In August 2020, I joined GeoMatrix Solutions as Senior Director of Geospatial Data Science. GeoMatrix, a leader in geospatial solutions, was at the forefront of applying cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to geospatial data analysis. My role here encompassed both technical leadership and strategic business development, overseeing a diverse team of data scientists, engineers, and geospatial analysts.

From the onset, I focused on building a collaborative and innovative environment, aiming to push the boundaries of what geospatial data science could achieve. One of my early initiatives was the creation of a geospatial analytics platform specifically designed for urban planning and smart city development. The platform integrates real-time data, AI-driven predictive modeling, and visualization tools, enabling cities to make data-driven decisions to improve traffic flow, manage resources, and enhance urban living conditions. Under my direction, the platform was adopted by three major cities in North America, and we measured a 15% reduction in urban congestion within the first year of implementation.

One of the proudest moments of my career was seeing the real-world impact of this work. In one particular case, our platform helped a city re-design its public transportation routes based on predictive models of commuter behavior, resulting in reduced travel times for over 150,000 daily commuters.

Alongside my technical responsibilities, I prioritized developing talent within the organization. Recognizing the need for a structured mentorship program, I initiated an internal scheme that paired junior data scientists with senior staff, with the goal of nurturing professional growth. Over the past two years, this initiative has fostered an environment of continuous learning, with a 30% increase in internal promotions. I have always believed that success is measured not just by what we accomplish individually, but by the growth of the people around us.

In addition to my internal contributions, I became increasingly involved in thought leadership activities. I authored four white papers on the intersection of artificial intelligence and GIS, focusing on how these technologies could be used to address urban challenges such as climate change, resource allocation, and infrastructure development. These papers were well-received by the broader industry, and I was invited to present at several conferences, where I discussed the potential of AI to reshape urban landscapes. One of these papers led to a collaboration with policymakers to draft new guidelines for sustainable urban development, a career highlight for me.

#### **BlueSky Tech (July 2016 \- July 2020\) – Geospatial Data Science Manager**

Before joining GeoMatrix, I spent four years at BlueSky Tech, where I served as the Geospatial Data Science Manager. My time at BlueSky marked a period of significant professional growth, where I transitioned from a primarily technical role into a leadership position. BlueSky was a fast-growing company focused on providing geospatial solutions to clients in the energy and environmental sectors. In this capacity, I led a team of 12 geospatial engineers and analysts responsible for delivering data-driven solutions to some of the world’s largest energy companies.

One of the most impactful projects I managed at BlueSky involved developing an early-warning system for wildfire detection. The system used satellite imagery, machine learning algorithms, and geospatial data to model and predict wildfire risk in vulnerable regions. Working closely with government agencies, my team built a robust system that was able to identify high-risk areas with unprecedented accuracy. This project was particularly challenging due to the sheer volume of data involved and the need for real-time analysis. However, through collaboration with various stakeholders and the integration of cloud computing technologies, we were able to process vast amounts of satellite imagery in real time. The system went live in 2019 and has since been credited with helping prevent several potential wildfire disasters by providing early warnings to local authorities.

In addition to the wildfire project, I oversaw the migration of BlueSky’s geospatial data pipelines to the cloud, which was one of the most technically demanding but ultimately rewarding tasks of my career. The company’s legacy infrastructure was not scalable enough to handle the increasing demand for geospatial analysis from clients. I led a cross-functional team that redesigned the data architecture, moving the pipelines to a cloud-based system that significantly improved both speed and reliability. This transition reduced data processing times by 40%, allowing us to deliver insights to clients faster and with greater accuracy. The efficiency gains saved our clients over $1 million annually in operational costs and strengthened our relationships with key stakeholders.

As a leader, I was equally committed to the professional growth of my team. Recognizing the potential in each team member, I developed a comprehensive training and development program that improved both technical skills and leadership capabilities. This focus on staff development not only boosted morale but also reduced turnover by 15%, a metric that I’m particularly proud of, as it reflected a deeper investment in the well-being of my team.
